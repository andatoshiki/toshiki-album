After this harsg 3 years of finding, ultimately a theme named \"phugo\" came across my eye sight on GitHub, but it didn't perform well as I expected to be, with some slight modification by myself a new theme called **rythm** is ultimately open sourced out on GitHub for my personal gallery/album usages. This gallery mostly contains my self collected anime illustrations, life photos and much more... Happy viewing :), good day. <br />Tech stack: **Aliyun cloud OSS+Picgo+GitHub pages+Vercel** (OSS located in HongKong for bumping viewing speed for mainland viewers also stabalize speed outer mainland.)"
